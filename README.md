# Proposal

We plan on making a miniature version of Reddit's r/place with emojis. This will include an interactive grid of 100 by 100 squares in which users can place emojis and view the emojis all other users have placed. A user can only place an emoji every 5 minutes (subject to change), which will be tied to their user account accross devices.

## Feature List
- Persistent data stored in MongoDB database
    - User accounts
        - When a user can next place an emoji
        - Login information
- Dynamic Javascript Behavior
    - Canvas updates with emojis the user and other users have placed
- Login Page
